## Flutter-Tasks
1. Take a list, say for example this one:
 a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

2. Take two lists, for example:
 a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]


  b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]


and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between them (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.


3. Write a program to check if a string is a palindrome or not.
A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. Eg mum


4. Write a program that takes a list of numbers for example
a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]


and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. For practice, write this code inside a function.




5. Write a program (using functions!) that asks the user for a long string containing multiple words. Print back to the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order.
For example, say I type the string:
 My name is Michele


Then I would see the string:
 Michele is name My


6. Write a program (function) that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the first list minus all the duplicates.


7. In this exercise, load that JSON file below, 
a, Extract the months of all the birthdays.
B, count how many birthdays in each month.
C, write a program to show the month with the heights and lowest birthday.
{
    "May": 3,
    "May": 5,
    "November": 2,
    "December": 1,
    "December": 4,
    "December": 2,
}
